title: Multi-purpose button for mBlazonry components with disabled state active
---

This is the multi-purpose button with 'disabled' state active (via css class name: .disabled). The use of the disabled state should be limited to when an action can not, or should not, be performed until a user has met the contextual requirement of said action (e.g. a submit button is disabled until a user has entered mandatory information in to a form).
