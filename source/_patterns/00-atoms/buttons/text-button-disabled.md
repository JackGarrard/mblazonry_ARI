title: Multi-purpose text-only button with disabled state active
---

This is a multi-purpose text button with 'disabled' state active (via css class name: .disabled). The disabled state is meant for user actions whose context is separate from the immediacy of the tasks available to the user and has been disabled due to the particulars of the task at hand, or whose action is currently unavailable (e.g. a 'read more' button that, if pressed, would lead to user data loss and therefore should be disabled until a task is completed).
