title: Multi-purpose text-only button with positive state active
---

This is a multi-purpose text button with 'positive' state active (via css class name: .positive). The caution state is meant for user actions whose context is separate from the immediacy of the tasks available to the user and has been deemed a positive action by the application (e.g. 'read more about our other products').
