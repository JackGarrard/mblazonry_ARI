title: Multi-purpose negative button for mBlazonry components with negative state active
---

This is the multi-purpose button with 'negative' state active (via css class name: .negative). It is meant to be used for user actions that require strong cautionary feedback from the application (e.g. when a user wishes to discard changes they have made, delete a file, or perform any action that may have potentially negative ramifications).
