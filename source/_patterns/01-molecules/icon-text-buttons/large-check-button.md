title: Multi-purpose check button for mBlazonry components with large state active
---

This is the multi-purpose icon text button with 'large' state active (via css class name: .large). The use of the large button state should be limited to when the application requires a user's attention be directed to an action of some importance (e.g. A user cannot user the application until they sign up, therefore the signup button should be given additional visual weight)
